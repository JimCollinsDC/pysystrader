pysystemtrade is the open source version of my own backtesting engine that implements systems according to the framework 
outlined in my book "Systematic Trading", which is further developed on my blog.

QTPyLib (Quantitative Trading Python Library) is a simple, event-driven algorithmic trading library written in Python, 
that supports backtesting, as well as paper and live trading via Interactive Brokers.
Using pub/sub architecture using Ã˜MQ (ZeroMQ) for communicating between the Algo and the Blotter allows 
for a single Blotter/multiple Algos running on the same machine.
Have orders delivered to your mobile via SMS (requires a Nexmo or Twilio account).
Full integration with TA-Lib via dedicated module (see documentation).
Ability to import any Python library (such as scikit-learn or TensorFlow) to use them in your algorithms.
Lastly, Your Strategies, which are sub-classes of Algo, handle the trading logic/rules. This is where you'll write most of your code.
